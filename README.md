# Priority-Changer

Simple funny **Chrome-Extension** to change the priority of your emails (web pages)...

--- 

Lots of people receive daily email, often an answer or a task must be completed *URGENT*, *ASAP* or *EOD*, etc…

These keywords sometimes generate anxiety or destroy daily mood.

**Common examples**:

- I need your spreadsheet **ASAP**  
- **URGENT**: Have you voted yet?  
- **RSVP**: Need your answer by **EOD**  


### How it works?

It read (in a completely anonymous way and without tracking anything) the *DOM* of a web page and when encounter one of these words, replace it a funny one (or the opposite):

**Urgent** -> Trivial  
**Important** -> Irrelevant  
**ASAP** -> next week  
**EOD** -> next week  
**RSVP** -> RWYW (respond when you want)  

### How to use?

Download the package, open Chrome Extensions and select “Load unpacked extension” and load the unpacked project.
